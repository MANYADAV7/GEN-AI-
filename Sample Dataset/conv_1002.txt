Patient: "I feel sleepy after reading a book for a while, especially in the morning when I get up early"
Doctor: "You know, do you feel that you are not interested in learning?"

Patient: "Because I have to endorse, it's really a bit boring. It's not as fun as watching TV or something."
Doctor: "Hmm, besides watching TV, are you still interested in other things that you were interested in before?"

Patient: "interested"

Doctor: "I understand, do you usually wake up earlier than the alarm clock in the morning?"

Patient: "I used to set an alarm clock for 8 o'clock. After a while, I would automatically wake up a few minutes earlier every time. Gradually, the alarm clock has been changed to 7:30."
Patient: "I don't know if I have formed a biological clock"
Doctor: "I understand, so I sleep fairly regularly every day"

Doctor: "In addition to being easily sleepy while studying, are there any other problems?"

Patient: "No other problems for the time being"
Doctor: "Okay, I understand. How are you feeling recently?"

Patient: "Okay"
Doctor: "I understand. It sounds like you have been feeling sleepy while studying recently due to preparations for exams, which makes you feel a little troubled. Don't worry too much. You can combine work and rest through exercise or other entertainment activities in your daily study life, and pay attention to relaxation."

Doctor: "Okay, then our consultation ends here"

Patient: "Okay"
Patient: "Thank you"
